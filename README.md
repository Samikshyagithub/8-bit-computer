We have incorporated 16 distinct instructions tailored to the specific requirements of 
our project. Our computer, named "RS8," employs a 4-bit opcode and a 4-bit address 
length. The hardware components of our computer include:
1. A memory with a capacity of 16x8.
2. Eight registers: IR, PC, A, B, OR, MBR, MAR, and SC.
3. A Binary to 7 Segment converter.
4. An 8-bit internal Bus.
5. Both 4-bit and 8-bit External Buses.
6. A Control Unit designed using Logisim's combinational analysis.
7. An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting operations such as addition, 
subtraction, XOR, AND, OR, etc
